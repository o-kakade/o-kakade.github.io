Hi, I am Omkar. I am a Software Engineer with experience building Scalable Web Applications, Production Grade Cloud Infrastructure, ML Pipelines, Serverless Applications and Internal tools. I'm currently working on [Drone-as-a-first-responder (DFR) solution](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/video-security-access-control/drones/cape-drone-software.html) for public safety with [Motorola Solutions](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us.html).

My primary interests include Distributed Systems and Infrastructure, AI/ML and Big Data Platforms. On here you will find stuff on my projects, documenting technical challenges and general blogs.

Originally from [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), I've also lived for a significant time in [UAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates), [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar) and now [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).

Outside of work, I am an avid motoring enthusiast and follow [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) which being a technical sport creates a positive feedback loop for my engineering curiosity and learning what under the hood components makes things perform. I also enjoy gaming, hiking and working out.
