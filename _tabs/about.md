Hi, I am Omkar. I am a Software Engineer with experience building serverless application for querying knowledge graphs using natural language and laying groundwork for a cloud based analytics pipeline for time series forecasting use cases using AWS Sagemaker.

My primary interests include Distributed Systems and Infrastructure, AI/ML and Big Data Platforms. On here you will find stuff on my projects, documenting technical challenges and general blogs.

I recently graduated with my Masters in Computer Science from [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu). Originally from [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), I've also lived for a significant time in [UAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates), [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar) and now [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).

Outside of work, I am an avid motoring enthusiast and follow [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) which being a technical sport creates a positive feedback loop for my engineering curiosity and learning what under the hood components makes things perform. I also enjoy gaming, hiking and working out.
