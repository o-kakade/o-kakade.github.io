Hi, I’m Omkar — a Software Engineer passionate about creating scalable web applications, production-grade cloud infrastructure, and cutting-edge AI/ML workflows. Right now, I’m working on a [Drone-as-a-first-responder (DFR) platform](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/video-security-access-control/drones/cape-drone-software.html) for public safety at [Motorola Solutions](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us.html). It’s an exciting blend of innovation and real-world impact.

I’m drawn to distributed systems, AI/ML, and big data platforms, always looking to push the boundaries of what technology can do. Here, you’ll find my latest projects, technical challenges, and occasional deep dives into topics that intrigue me.

Originally from [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), I've also lived in [UAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates), [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) & now [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada). These experiences have shaped my approach towards technology and problem-solving, giving me a global perspective.

When I’m not coding or tinkering with new tech, you’ll probably find me indulging my passion for motorsports—especially [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/). F1 also fuels my curiosity to explore what makes things tick “under the hood”. I’m also into gaming, hiking, and staying active at the gym.
