## First Post: Building the Site

After much deliberation—researching frameworks, themes, hosting solutions, and domain names—I finally decided to keep things simple with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Originally, I planned to host it on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with a [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) domain, but that turned out to be overkill for a personal blog.

I did build an initial prototype on AWS, but the hosting costs and extra effort of updating static pages on S3 didn’t seem worth it, even with the potential for automation using GitHub Actions.

In the end, Jekyll provides all the features I need for a static website, and hosting it on Github Pages with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme keeps things easy and low-maintenance. Now, I’ve finally got a place to document and share my projects, thoughts, and technical challenges online.
