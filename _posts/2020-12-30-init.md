First post on the site. After much pondering, researching frameworks, themes, hosting solutions, domain names, the answer is simple -> [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Original thought was to serve from [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and use domain name from [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). 

Built an intital prototype but the hosting cost plus updating on [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (can automate deployment with Github Actions, still) is extra toil compared to the utility of this site.  

Jekyll provides all the features for a simple static website, hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and using the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, finally have a place to document stuff online and share it easily.
